# RePath Mobile (prototype)

Minimal React Native (Expo) prototype that:
- asks for location (or ZIP)
- loads a municipality pack
- renders up to 5 ranked Option Cards
- uses a bundled search index (`assets/packs/search.json`) for lookup

This is a thin proof-of-concept. Replace bundled packs with remote manifest + cached downloads.
